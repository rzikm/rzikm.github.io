I am in the last year of my Master studies at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles
University. Currently, I am working on my Master thesis - implementing the QUIC protocol in .NET
(available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rzikm/master-thesis)). I am also teaching lab sessions for .NET development lectures.
